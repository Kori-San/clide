# *Description*
```
Hello, CLIde: $
```
CLIde is a little project I'm doing to improve myself on multiple point.

- Make cleaner code:
    - Refactor to have a clean main.
    - Re-use or adapt function instead of creating functions that have very similar operations.
    - Make useful and clean comments.

- Improve my coding approach:
    - Make some small steps instead of big leaps in a project.
    - Try to think without global vars.
    - Make re-usable functions / class and methods.

- Improve my skills:
    - Dive deeper into Class-based programming.
    - Try to anticipate and control user's input.
    - Try to anticipate issues and user's reviews.

# Miscellenaous
- I tried to use [Mintifly's Doc Writter](https://www.mintlify.com/writer) to have a clean base for my docs, I improved it afterwards if needed.

- I tried to use type annotations and optionnal arguments to add comprehension to my functions.
